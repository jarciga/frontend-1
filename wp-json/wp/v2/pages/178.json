Trucks are loaded on-site and travel to a laydown facility located closer to port, where product is off-loaded and stored until ready to be transported to ship.<\/p>\n<p>The Sparkler project is well positioned with access to Muirs Highway and easy connection to South Western Highway. Both Highways are used for double road trains. The Antwalker Project is not quite as straight forward, as a short interconnection from this site to the South Western Highway would be required, and these approvals would need to be sought and granted. The Pipeclay Project is however ideally situated for access to the South Western Highway.<\/p>\n<p>If available, Berth 8 at Bunbury Port would probably be the most viable option for the Company as it has the ship-loading system suitable for the efficient loading of silica sand. In 2020 indications were that some capacity did exist at Berth 8, however future capacity remains unknown. Berth 5 may also be an option for the Company, but would require investment in ship-loading equipment, however this location could potentially allow for product storage, thereby eliminating the need for product laydown elsewhere.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div><\/div><div id=\"pgc-178-2-1\"  class=\"panel-grid-cell\" ><div id=\"panel-178-2-1-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_text panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"4\" >\t\t\t<div class=\"textwidget\"><p style=\"font-size: 12px; text-align: right;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1759\" src=\"https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Bunbury.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Bunbury.png 640w, https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Bunbury-300x216.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><em>Bunbury Port<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div><\/div><\/div><div id=\"pg-178-3\"  class=\"panel-grid panel-no-style\" ><div id=\"pgc-178-3-0\"  class=\"panel-grid-cell\" ><div id=\"panel-178-3-0-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_text panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"5\" >\t\t\t<div class=\"textwidget\"><div style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;\" align=\"justify\"><strong>Dual Port Strategy with Albany Port<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It may be possible for the Company to have a dual Port strategy for the South-West projects by considering Albany Port as an option.

This could include access to a range of their services such as bulk storage and manning of operations\/stevedoring. They have also suggested cost efficiencies by sharing ship loading resources with other mineral companies operating in the region.

In this package, approximately $18 million was identified for immediate infrastructure upgrade to the Bunbury Port. Also announced, was $3.8 million funding for the preparation of a feasibility study for upgrade and new infrastructure at both the Bunbury and Kwinana Ports to support the possible reopening of the Greenbushes rail line. The upgrading of port facilities, and the re-opening of the Greenbushes rail line, could have positive benefits for any future project logistics capabilities and costs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Portside Processing to be Investigated<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Company plans to investigate the cost benefits of developing its own processing facilities in designated industrial areas within close proximity to the ports. This would allow greater access to both human resources and established infrastructure\/utilities. It believes its operations will be less intrusive for the surrounding communities (particularly those in the South-West Projects). It would also allow for resources to be transported from multiple sites.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Indicative Cost Estimation<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Company has received cost per tonne rates inclusive of all costs of road transportation, lay-down facilities and port handling and loading charges.
