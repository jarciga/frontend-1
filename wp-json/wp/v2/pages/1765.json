Project 2 is called <strong>Antwalker\/Pipeclay Tree<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This region has an extensive history of exploration, some of which falls within the tenement areas. Whilst no large-scale mining operations have eventuated within the tenement areas, there are however many other operating mining projects and substantial agricultural and other primary industry enterprises located within this region. As a result, infrastructure has been well established to support industry, along with the residential townships that provide for the communities that service them.<\/p>\n<p>Each location can be accessed via excellent quality, all-weather sealed highways and major roads, with the tenement areas being readily accessible by a mix of sealed and gravel\/sand access roads. The local roads \u2013 some of which may require upgrade to support any proposed future mining operations \u2013 are both suitable and accessible all year round for exploration teams and their associated equipment, including drill rigs.<\/p>\n<p>The location of each of these Projects also gives easy access to the major highways needed to transport the resource to holding, processing and shipping facilities.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div><\/div><div id=\"pgc-1765-1-1\"  class=\"panel-grid-cell\" ><div id=\"panel-1765-1-1-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_media_image panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"2\" ><img width=\"991\" height=\"691\" src=\"https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/South-west-Projects-updated-map.jpg\" class=\"image wp-image-2301  attachment-full size-full\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"max-width: 100%; height: auto;\" srcset=\"https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/South-west-Projects-updated-map.jpg 991w, https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/South-west-Projects-updated-map-300x209.jpg 300w, https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/South-west-Projects-updated-map-768x536.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 991px) 100vw, 991px\" \/><\/div><\/div><\/div><div id=\"pg-1765-2\"  class=\"panel-grid panel-no-style\" ><div id=\"pgc-1765-2-0\"  class=\"panel-grid-cell\" ><div id=\"panel-1765-2-0-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_text panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"3\" >\t\t\t<div class=\"textwidget\"><div style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 18px;\" align=\"justify\">\n<strong>Geology<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Company\u2019s tenements are located on elevated sand plains and the residual laterite terrain of the Biranup Zone in the Proterozoic Albany-Fraser Orogen of South-Western Australia.<\/p>\n<p>It is underlain by quartzo-feldspathic gneisses, mainly derived from granitoid rocks of the Biranup and Nornalup Complexes.
