It operated as a non-trading dormant company from registration until May 2020.

It considers that this strategy of multiple projects, multiple processing facilities and multiple ports, reduces the risks associated with the variables and approvals required to transition from exploration into commercial production.  And, further to this, the Company is exploring for multiple silica sand deposits within each of the individual project locations.  This it believes will further mitigate any localised risks that may emerge.<\/p>\n<p>This commercial strategy also brings advantages aside from those associated with risk reduction.<\/p>\n<p>One of the dynamics of silica sand exploration is that regardless of the underlying deposit potential, or the estimated mineral resource size, typically the limiting factors relating to production are more likely to be associated with logistics, port access and shipping availability.  Multiple projects, with multiple port access, affords the benefits and opportunities associated with operational scale because of the advantages multiple locations give.<\/p>\n<h3>Operations<\/h3>\n<p>During the investigative phase of exploration, the Company looked for a mix of site locations, but ideally those with potential for high-purity grades of silica, balanced with the opportunity to efficiently and cost effectively treat, and then transport those resources to\/from processing facilities close to a port facility.<\/p>\n<p>These investigations led to the identification of target areas in both southern and northern locations of Western Australia and in the Northern Territory.  All project locations come with the benefits of processing and transportation from industrial facilities and ports close by.  The northern ports of Wyndham and Darwin have the added benefit of being in much closer proximity to the ports of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region than those ports of the south, so this gives the Company the option of transporting both raw and refined product.<\/p>\n<p>The Company has adopted a clear plan and pathway for progressing its operations including testwork programs and community, landowner and custodian communications. Currently its principal focus is on its <a href=\"https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/project\/south-west-project-sparkler\/\">SPARKLER<\/a> project, although considerable work is also being undertaken at its <a href=\"https:\/\/allupsilica.com\/project\/esperance-project\/\">ESPERANCE<\/a> projects.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ABOUT US Establishment The Company was incorporated and registered in Western Australia on the 5th of April 2013.
